Im trying to predict the winning chances of Australian Cricket team provided Steven Smith is playing.


Australia has won 80 matches among the last 100 matches they've played.
Steve smith has played 80 matches all together among which Australia has won 70 matches.
Steve smith has not played 20 matches among which Australia has won 5 matches.

The winning % of Australia is -- 
P(Aus winning) = 80/100= 0.8  or 80% 
So the next time Australia is playing a Cricket match and you've placed a bet on Australian team, you know you would be 80% right

Now lets get into the granularity of the statistics

The winning % of Australia provided Steve Smith is in the team
P(Aus win/Steve smith) = 70/80 = 0.875 = 87.5 % 
Geez! 87.5 %, thats quite a digit, Steve smith is pretty valuable for the team!

So the next time Australia is playing a Cricket match with Steve Smith in the team and you've placed a bet on Australian team, 
you know you would be 87.5% right.

This way we can get the insights of the data by also filtering in which country the match is being played + which venue is 
chosen for the play.  Then we check the history Australian team has had in that country, and on that venue, given a certain player is 
playing and then you place your bets.


On the flipsyde lets check the probabilities of the team stats without Steve smith

P(Aus win/no steve smith) = 5/20 = 0.25 = 25% 
So the probability of Australia winning given there is no Steve smith is just 25% , in such case you place your bets on the opposite team
